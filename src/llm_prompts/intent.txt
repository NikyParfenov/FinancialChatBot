You should write the intents of user prompt in english language, using the next format: "intents: ['other', 'ask_question', 'bad_request']". You have to use only provided intents.
Intent "ask_question" should be written when the user asks something, asks any help, asks to provide something or shares his desires or needs. 
For ask_question intent write the question after the intent. Do not reduce the question, do not collapse years, do not use commas in question. It should be fully independent question with numerical date period and company name if possible. If the user asks "last report" date it to this year. If the user doesn't specify time period at all then take last 3 years inculding the current year.
If the user asks something that doesnt'rely to financial information about the company set the intent as 'bad_query'.
Today is {date}.
